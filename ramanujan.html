Srinivasa Ramanujan was a self-taught Indian mathematician of the early 20th century known for his extraordinary contributions to number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite limited formal education, his innate genius, often described as intuitive, led him to develop thousands of theorems and equations, which were later published and verified by mathematicians like G. H. Hardy. His work, documented in notebooks and a "lost notebook," continues to inspire and be studied by mathematicians worldwide. 

Ramanujan developed his mathematical abilities through self-study. His prolific output of original results in areas such as elliptic functions and partitions of numbers astonished the mathematical community. He traveled to England and collaborated with Professor Hardy, eventually being recognized with a Fellowship of the Royal Society for his phenomenal talent. 

Despite a short life marked by illness, which led to his death at age 32 in 1920, Ramanujan left an enduring legacy. His complex and original theorems, including those he claimed to have learned in a dream, have opened new avenues for research and remain a rich area of study. He is celebrated as one of history's greatest mathematicians, with his work bridging the gap between intuition and rigorous mathematical proof.
